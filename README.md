# Welcome to Truckup Calendar ðŸ‘‹

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start Project
    ios

   ```bash
    npm run ios
   ```
   
  - android

   ```bash
    npm run android
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

# Project Structure

This project follows the **Atomic Design** methodology to ensure a reusable and scalable structure. The structure is organized as follows:

- **Atoms (Elements):** Basic and indivisible components, such as box, text, and icons.
- **Molecules (Components):** Combinations of atoms that form simple functional blocks, such as iconButton.
- **Organisms (Container):** Complex sections of the interface, composed of molecules and atoms, that together form a complete functional area of the application.
- **Templates (Screen):** Page structures that combine organisms, providing layouts for different views of the application.

## State Management

We are using **Redux** for state management, ensuring a predictable and easy-to-debug architecture. This allows the application state to be managed centrally, facilitating code maintenance and scalability.

## Testing Facilitation with Expo

To facilitate testing and development, we are using **Expo**. Expo simplifies the setup and development process of React Native applications, providing powerful tools for testing and deployment.

## Light and Dark Mode Animation

The project includes an animation for light and dark mode, which is currently disabled to avoid bias in the analysis. However, a demonstration video of the animation is attached below.
